# AdventOfCode23

**Description**

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

In 2023, by doing it daily I reached day 9, scoring a total of 16 stars.
